Hi there! 👋 I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student of the School of Mathematics of <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn">University of Science and Technology of China</a> and also a visiting student in <a href="https://nus.edu.sg">National University of Singapore</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://hanzhangqin.com">Prof. Hanzhang Qin</a>.

My research interests include optimization and operations research. I'm currently working on projects related to Smart Predict-then-Optimize and large language models (LLMs). More details are here: [Sihan's CV](CV.pdf).
